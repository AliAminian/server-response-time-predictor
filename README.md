# Ideas
1) In a server/client scenarios that different services from server-side application, response time of a server for its services could be vital for client. This module could predict the response time of an especial service. Indeed, the response time as an important factor  helps administrators to make a suitalbe decision in different situations in real-world usage of services for their servers to be responsive and available.
2) There are many multi-instance server side applications that number of instantians of these applications depends on the hardware used in server machine (RAM Space, Cpu cors, etc). In fact, developers and tester may not pre-define a constant number for their multi-instance server-side applications for different operational environmetns. Based on this module we could have a intelligent module for automatically tunning the number of instanciation with prediction the response time of different instance of server application.
